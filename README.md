# Ved - Collection of Sanskrit Texts

Welcome to **Ved**, a collection of Sanskrit verses and thoughtful expressions stored in simple `.ved` files.

##  Overview

As a lifelong rasika of Sanskrit, the language that feels less learned and more remembered—I had to dive into this as soon as I heard of it.  
Ved is my attempt: a collection of set of scripts written in a custom "Vedic" programming language.

##  What this contains

A bunch of files written in संस्कृतस्य !! 

##  How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Elysian0987/Ved.git
cd Ved
````

Install the Vedic language interpreter:

```bash
npm install -g vedic-lang-cli
```

Run the program (example with `pratham.ved`):

```bash
vedic pratham.ved
```

You should see the output:

```
नमस्ते भारतम्!
```

Similarly, you can run the other files:

```bash
vedic Panchatatva.ved
vedic Subhashita.ved
```

##  Contributions

##  Why

That’s it.
